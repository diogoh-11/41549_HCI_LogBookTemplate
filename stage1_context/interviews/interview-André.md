## Task Overview

**What task is the user trying to accomplish?**  
The user wants to monitor and optimize energy consumption at home, including consumption by room, solar panel production, and electric car charging.

**What are the main pain points or difficulties they experience?**  
- They cannot easily understand where they can save more energy.  
- The difference between production and consumption is not always clear.  
- The lack of details in home consumption makes analysis difficult.  
- They have to use different apps to meet their needs because none of them encompass everything they require.

**Are there any workarounds or strategies they currently use?**  
- They use an app to view general data, but feel it lacks personalization.  
- They manually compare days to identify patterns.  
- They adjust electric car charging based on EDP tariffs.

## Tools & Environment

**What tools or methods does the user currently rely on?**  
- Energy consumption monitoring app.  
- EDP reports to check tariffs.  
- Manual adjustment of electrical devices usage.

**Are there any frustrations or limitations with these tools?**  
- The app doesn’t always present data clearly or intuitively.  
- They can’t distinguish which device might be consuming too much.  
- Lack of direct suggestions on how to save energy.  
- Difficulty visualizing consumption by room in detail.

**What features do they wish these tools had?**  
- Personalized savings recommendations.  
- View of consumption by room and device.  
- Ability to include the electric car and its consumption breakdown in the app.  
- Automatic comparison between consumption and solar production.  
- Alerts for abnormal consumption.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach

**What would an ideal solution look like for them?**  
- A system that shows exactly where they are spending the most energy and where they can save.  
- Better visualization of solar production vs. consumption.  
- Direct suggestions on changes they can make to reduce costs.  
- Include electric car and options for remote charging start and stop.

**What concerns or hesitations do they have about new approaches?**  
- That the interface might be complex and difficult to use.  
- That the recommendations might not be accurate or useful.  
- Lack of inclusion of all their devices and needs.

**How do they measure success for completing the task efficiently?**  
- Reduction in the electricity bill.  
- Less energy waste.  
- Better understanding of consumption patterns over time.  
- Including all their devices (car, panels, etc.).

## Additional Observations  
- The user feels the current app is not intuitive enough.  
- There is interest in integrating hourly tariffs to optimize electric car charging.
