## Task Overview 

 **What task is the user trying to accomplish?** 

The user wants to monitor their energy consumption to reduce costs and be more energy efficient. They currently use an app provided by their utility company that tracks usage but provides minimal insights. Their goal is to identify specific ways to lower their electricity bill and understand what is consuming the most energy in their home. 

**What are the main pain points or difficulties they experience?** 
- The app only provides a general overview of daily or monthly power usage but doesn’t break down which appliances or behaviors contribute the most.
- There are no actionable recommendations on how to reduce consumption, just raw data. 
- The app lacks real-time alerts for excessive usage, meaning the user only finds out about spikes after receiving a high bill.

**Are there any workarounds or strategies they currently use?** 
- The user manually compares their bills month-to-month to try to spot trends.
- They use smart plugs on major appliances to track individual energy consumption.
- They rely on online research or trial and error to figure out how to lower their usage.

## Expectations for a Novel Approach 

**What would an ideal solution look like for them?** 
- A user-friendly app that not only tracks energy usage but also explains why the user is consuming so much and how to reduce it.
- Integration with smart home devices to automatically detect which appliances are consuming the most power.

- A feature that provides daily or weekly reports on energy-saving opportunities. 

**What concerns or hesitations do they have about new approaches?**

- Reduction in energy bills over time.
- Understanding which behaviors impact their consumption the most.
