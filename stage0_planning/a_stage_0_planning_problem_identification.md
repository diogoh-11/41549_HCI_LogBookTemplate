# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem
- The problem we identified is the lack of integration between apps and their functionalities. Existing apps that track electricity consumption often provide vague data, making it difficult for users to see which specific appliances are consuming energy. We aim to develop a service that can track all household appliances, accurately display energy consumption by area, and integrate emerging technologies such as electric vehicles and solar panels.  


# Context
[What is the context for your work. What area of application. It can be travelling, pet treatment, shopping. State the overall context and why it is interesting to think about it.]

- Domestic electricity consumption management is an essential aspect of modern household efficiency. With the increasing cost of electricity and growing concerns about environmental sustainability, managing energy consumption effectively has become a priority. Many households struggle to track and optimize their energy usage, leading to higher bills and unnecessary energy waste. By exploring solutions in this domain, we can contribute to cost savings, energy conservation, and a reduced carbon footprint.

# Challenges
[What are aspects that remain a challenge? What is difficult to do? What could profit from a more customizable approach?]

- **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring**: Many households do not have access to real-time electricity consumption data, making it difficult to identify and reduce energy waste.  
- **High Electricity Costs**: Without a clear understanding of which appliances consume the most energy, users struggle to implement cost-saving strategies.  
- **Behavioral Habits**: Changing household energy habits requires awareness and motivation, which many users lack due to limited feedback mechanisms.  
- **Integration with Smart Home Systems**: Not all households have smart appliances or energy-efficient devices, making energy management a challenge.  
- **Customizability**: Different households have different energy needs, and a one-size-fits-all approach does not always work. A more personalized and adaptive system could improve efficiency. 
- **Integration of New Technologies**: With the sudden rise of electric cars and solar panels, it could become even harder to track productivity and costs effectively.

# The goal
[In a short sentence state what is the problem you wish to address]

- To develop an effective system for managing domestic electricity consumption by providing real-time tracking, personalized recommendations, and cost-saving strategies to promote energy efficiency and sustainability.
