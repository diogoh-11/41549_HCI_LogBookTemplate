# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: Alberto wants to know which of his devices installed in the living room are consuming the most energy.

Alberto wants to monitor the energy consumption of his devices in the living room. Using his smart energy management system, he aims to identify which devices are consuming the most power. With this information, he can adjust usage patterns and potentially reduce electricity costs.

## Scenario 2: Checking how much energy the solar panel has produced this month.

Alberto wants to review his solar panel's energy production this month to evaluate if his investment was a good decision.

## Scenario 3: Alberto needs to see how long it will take for his car to be fully charged.

Since Alberto is going on a long trip, he needs his vehicle to be fully charged. He wants to see if charging will take too much time.

## Scenario 4: Alberto automates his smart home energy system.

After configuring the system, Alberto wants it to prioritize charging his electric vehicle and powering major appliances during peak solar energy production.

## Scenario 5: Alberto compares rates from different energy companies.

Alberto thinks he is spending too much money on energy at the end of the month, so he wants to compare his costs with other companies to see if he would save more money by switching to another electricity provider.
