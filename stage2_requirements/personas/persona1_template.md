**Name:** [Roberto Santos]  
**Age:** [37]  
**Occupation:** [Accountant]  
**Location:** [Aveiro, Portugal]  

## Background   
Roberto studied in Gondomar and later found a good job opportunity in Aveiro, so he moved there. He has been living in Aveiro for 12 years with his wife and their three children. 

## Daily Life  
Roberto usually gets up early to take his eldest son to school and then goes to work, while his wife stays at home taking care of their newborn baby. Roberto returns home around dusk and relaxes on the couch watching television before dinner.  
The money he and his wife make is very tight to cover all their expenses and still bring some happiness to their children, so they are looking for ways to save a few more euros.

## Goals & Needs  

Roberto wants to feel a bit more at ease and financially comfortable. He believes that having the ability to see which household appliances consume the most energy is one way to save some money at the end of the month.  
Roberto is aware that he and his family excessively use devices such as heaters, air conditioners, televisions, computers, among others, and he is looking for ways to reduce their energy consumption each month.

## Pain Points & Challenges  

- Not having access to the detailed energy consumption of each of his appliances  
- Finding a system that is practical and easy to use  
- Discovering what adjustments and changes he can make to save energy

## Motivation  

*"If I could see exactly where our energy goes, Iâ€™d know how to cut costs and make life a little easier for my family."*
