# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results

## Key Findings from User Evaluations
Through usability testing and heuristic evaluations, we identified several opportunities for improvement:

### 1. Consumption Reporting Needs  
- Users required clearer overviews of total energy usage patterns  
- *"I want to see my weekly total at a glance before diving into details"* - Participant 3  
- Most of testers looked for summary statistics first

### 2. Time Selection Accessibility  
- Temporal controls required excessive scrolling   
- Most users not found period selection easily

### 3. Data Visualization Clarity  
- Most users struggled with stacked graph differentiation  
- Color contrast ratios below WCAG AA standards (3.8:1)  
- Missing interactive data exploration features


# Refinement List
Based on findings, we prioritized:

1. **Summary Statistics Section**  
   - Prominent consumption overview panel showing:  
     - Total energy used (kWh)  
     - Cost estimate   
   - Always-visible on top of list view

2. **Redesigned Time Controls**  
   - Sticky filter header with:  
     - Quick-preset buttons (Hr/Day/Mo)  
     - Custom range date picker  
   - Always-visible near time and in the beginning of the page

3. **Enhanced Visualization**  
   - Added:  
     - More details of graph
     - Pattern-highlighting on hover  
   - More information details easy t saw
